\section{Research Experience}
\runsubsection{MIT Media Lab}
\descript{| Advanced Undergraduate Research Assistant }
\location{September 2020 - Present}
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Conducting research on pushing the resource and communication efficiency limits of distributed machine learning
\item  Detecting potential security breaches and designing membership inference attack, reconstruction attack in split neural network method
\item Constructing differential privacy mechanisms for resisting above mentioned attacks in split learning.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{MIT Media Lab}
\descript{| Undergraduate Research Assistant}
\location{February 2020 - September 2020}
\vspace{3mm} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented differentially private contact tracing algorithms and a variant of sketch data structure(DAMS) for GPS trails in Python 
\item Reduced the execution time from 10 hours(normal sketch data structures) to 2600 seconds(DAMS)
\item Increased the accuracy of contact tracing from 20 \%(normal sketch data structures) to 93 \%(DAMS) in trajectory datasets
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{MIT CSAIL}
\descript{| Undergraduate Research Assistant }
\location{June 2020 â€“ Aug 2020}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Researched on M5 Prime model to predict harvesting time and yield of cannabis in controlled environments such as greenhouses and indoor farms under the influence of artificial lighting and got 94.7\% accuracy
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics}
\descript{| Undersgraduate Research Assistant}
\location{February 2020 - May 2020}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a mask RCNN model for detecting black and white striped trails from variance map of images captured from 4 space cameras. Those trails are potentially moving asteroids and comets
